# 🌊 Trash Plastic Detection System – Web Interface  
**NASA Space Apps Challenge 2021: Leveraging AI/ML for Plastic Marine Debris**

---

## 🌍 Overview  

Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Our **Trash Plastic Detection System** uses **AI/ML and computer vision** to detect plastic debris from **satellite, drone, and underwater images or videos**.  

The **web interface** serves as the **central hub** for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing detected plastics from various sources such as satellites, drones, or underwater robots. It helps visualize pollution data, monitor cleanup progress, and inspire public awareness.


## 🧠 Key Features  

### 🚀 Detection & Upload  
- Upload **videos or images** of oceans, rivers, or lakes.  
- The backend processes these files using the **YOLO deep learning model** to detect plastics.  

### 🛰️ Data Integration  
- AI systems embedded in **satellites, drones, or submarines** automatically detect plastics and send results to the same web database.  

### 📊 Visualization  
- The dashboard displays:  
  - Detected plastic debris images  
  - Statistical graphs showing daily detection reports  

### 🧩 Restricted Upload Access  
- Only authenticated users (e.g., partner organizations or devices) can upload data.
